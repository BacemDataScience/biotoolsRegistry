# What is biotoolsregistry?
**biotoolsregistry** is the Web application of the [Tools & Data Services Registry](https://bio.tools).  It allows the curation and discovery of bioinformatics resources including databases, tools, services and so on, available under a variety of interfaces. 

biotoolsregistry provides a query interface, registration interface and API. The query interface allows a user to search the corpus of resource descriptions, display what fields of information are shown and filter and sort the results by various attributes.  The registration interface allows the manual creation and editing of resource descriptions.  The HTTP-based API allows query as well as automated creation and update of accessions.

biotoolsregistry depends upon a resource description model: [biotoolsXSD](https://bio.tools/biotoolsXSD).

# Motivation
In support of discoveries in the life sciences, a plethora of databases and tools are deployed, in technically complex and diverse implementations, across a spectrum of scientific disciplines. The corpus of documentation of these resources is fragmented across the Web, with much redundancy, and has lacked a common standard of information. The outcome is that scientists must often struggle to find, understand, compare and use the best resources for the task at hand.  The need - which biotoolsregistry supports - is for a comprehensive and consistent registry of information about bioinformatics resources.
