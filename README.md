# What is biotoolsregistry?
**biotoolsregistry** is the Web application of the [Tools & Data Services Registry](https://bio.tools).  It allows the curation and discovery of bioinformatics resources including databases, tools, services and so on, available under a variety of interfaces. 

biotoolsregistry provides a query interface, registration interface and API. The **query interface** allows a user to search the corpus of resource descriptions, display what fields of information are shown and filter and sort the results by various attributes.  The **registration interface** allows the manual creation and editing of resource descriptions.  The HTTP-based **API** allows query as well as automated creation and update of accessions.

biotoolsregistry depends upon a resource description model: [biotoolsXSD](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsXSD).

# Motivation
In support of discoveries in the life sciences, a plethora of databases and tools are deployed, in technically complex and diverse implementations, across a spectrum of scientific disciplines. The corpus of documentation of these resources is fragmented across the Web, with much redundancy, and has lacked a common standard of information. The outcome is that scientists must often struggle to find, understand, compare and use the best resources for the task at hand.  The need - which biotoolsregistry supports - is for a comprehensive and consistent registry of information about bioinformatics resources.

# Documentation and website

The Tools & Data Services Registry, supported by ELIXIR â€” the European infrastructure for biological information - is available at 

https://bio.tools

You will find the documentation from the "Help" menu and further informatiom about the project from the "About" menu.

# Source code
We are in the middle of a major code rewrite and will look to opening the code for the new registry interfaces once this is completed. For enquiries please contact the [registry mailing list](mailto:registry@elixir-dk.org).

# Governance
biotoolsregistry development is covered by the emerging [governance model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bHg_-HAUFKbWg1O2XWmrmJZOcNMDzcFyrqGVm4FWk0/edit#) of the bio.tools project.  

# People
