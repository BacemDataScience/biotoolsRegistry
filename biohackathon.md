## Background information
The proposal is for (ideally many) representatives of the bio.tools and related projects including EDAM, biotoolsSchema, Tool Information Standards etc. to attend all week to host a running "drop-in" session with each day focused on a specific theme.  Themes will be tailored to delegates but might include 1. bio.tools open development process.  2.  bio.tools critique & bug fix.  3. Planning EDAM 2.0.0.   4. EDAM Formats curation.  5. bio.tools content improvement from an end-user perspective.  6. bio.tools annotation consistency.  7. EDAM coverage of bio.tools.  8. edamMap optimisation.  9. edamBrowse brainstorming. 10. Anything else !

## Focus of each day
**Tue Nov 13** bio.tools testing, evaluation and optimisation)
**Wed Nov 14** EDAM development
**Thu Nov 15** Workflows in bio.tools
**Fri Nov 16** fdsfds

## bio.tools testing 
The purpose is to test, evaluate and optimise the development deployment of bio.tools (https://dev.bio.tools/), changes in which are scheduled to be moved into production (https://bio.tools/) during Dec 3-7.

**Task 1** bio.tools release testing
Currently 28 issues labelled ("done - staged for release")[https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsregistry/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22done+-+staged+for+release%22] are implemented in https://dev.bio.tools.  Before these can be moved into production, we need independent verification that these features and fixes have been satisfactorily implemented.  The task is to work through the ("done - staged for release")[https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsregistry/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22done+-+staged+for+release%22] issues, read the thread, test things are working as advertised, and add a comment to the thread (either reporting things look are OK, or describing outstanding problems).  Once an issue is verified in this way, bio.tools-dev will attach the ("fix verified")[https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsRegistry/labels/fix%20verified] label (having first fixed any issues raised).

**Task 2** bio.tools development priorities
We label issues to reflect their status and priority:
* ("critical priority")[https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsRegistry/labels/critical%20priority] : our top-priorities, including most of the reported (bugs)[https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsRegistry/labels/bug]  
* ("in progress")[https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsRegistry/labels/in%20progress] : things we're working on currently
