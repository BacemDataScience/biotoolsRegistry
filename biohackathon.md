## Background information

The proposal is for (ideally many) representatives of the bio.tools and related projects including EDAM, biotoolsSchema, Tool Information Standards etc. to attend all week to host a running "drop-in" session with each day focused on a specific theme.  Themes will be tailored to delegates but might include 1. bio.tools open development process.  2.  bio.tools critique & bug fix.  3. Planning EDAM 2.0.0.   4. EDAM Formats curation.  5. bio.tools content improvement from an end-user perspective.  6. bio.tools annotation consistency.  7. EDAM coverage of bio.tools.  8. edamMap optimisation.  9. edamBrowse brainstorming. 10. Anything else !
